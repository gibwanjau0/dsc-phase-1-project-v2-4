Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## DATA ANALYSIS

### What is the relationship between popularity and release date?¶


while doing this analysis i i identified an important aspect in the filming industry which is seasonality. This element is likely to increase the ratings and popularity of a film in a very short time. Based on my findibgs summer holidays and during the minth of december is regarded as an ideal time of the year to release a movie. The high popularity is most likely nifluenced by the december holiday as well as the chrismass break. From this findings a movie released in the month of december is most likely hass higher chances of success and high return on investment.
